## [Project 2 - Realtime Bitcoin Price API Scraping and Visualization](https://github.com/GraceLQ/bitcoin_realtime_price)

This project demonstrates how I scraped, processed, and visualized Bitcoin price data using the CoinGecko API via the Python wrapper PyCoinGecko. It retrieves Bitcoin price data for the previous 30 days, processes it into a structured DataFrame, and visualizes the results with an interactive HTML-based candlestick chart generated using Plotly.

- Worked with **RESTful APIs** for retrieving real-time and historical data.
- Used Pandas for data manipulation, such as aggregating daily price metrics, and converting **time-series data**.
- Created interactive candlestick charts using **Plotly**.
